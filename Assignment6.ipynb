    "# Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is a methodology of programming in which the idea of objects to represent data and methods, is used. \n",
    "Their are four pillars of object-oriented programming: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation\n",
    "It describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit e.g. a class. This concept is also often used to hide the internal representation, or state, of an object from the outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstraction\n",
    "Abstraction is selecting data from a larger pool to show only the relevant details to the object. It helps to reduce programming complexity and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms."

    "# Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    " - Better Productivity as OOP techniques enforce rules on a programmer that, in the long run, help her get more work done; finished programs work better, have more features and are easier to read and maintain. \n",
    " - Objects can also be reused within an across applications. The reuse of software also lowers the cost of development. \n",
    " - It provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes in which implementation details are hidden."

    "# Question 3\n",
    " \n",
    "A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.\n",
    "2. A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class.\n"

    "# Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "1. #### Class\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. #### Object\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. #### Attribute\n",
    "In Object-oriented programming(OOP), classes and objects have attributes. Attributes are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state or quality of the class or instance. In short, attributes store information about the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. #### Behavior\n",
    "The behavior of an object is defined by its methods, which are the functions and subroutines defined within the object class. Without class methods, a class would simply be a structure. Methods determine what type of functionality a class has, how it modifies its data, and its overall behavior.\n"
